My name is Emmet and I'm a developer (just like everyone else using GitHub). My interests outside of academia include cooking, exercising, and drawing. One day I hope to pursue a career as a researcher, making the world a better place. Find out how to reach me at [my website](https://mineable3.github.io/).
